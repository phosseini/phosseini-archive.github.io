      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pedram is a PhD student in the department of Computer Science at the George Washington University (GWU) doing his research under supervision of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seas.gwu.edu/mona-diab&#34;&gt;Dr. Mona Diab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seas.gwu.edu/david-broniatowski&#34;&gt;Dr. David Broniatowski&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His main areas of interest are Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Pedramâ€™s current research focuses on providing an analytical framework for understanding how individuals make various decisions on social media, including spread of mis/disinformation and fake news, and more broadly in interconnected networks. He also works on developing NLP models to extract causal relations, explicit nd implicit, in language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining GWU, Pedram spent a year at Sharif University of Technology as a visiting researcher focusing on NLP research. Prior to this, his master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, completed at Guilan University, led to development of a sentiment analysis platform for Persian. Pedram is extremely passionate about entrepreneurship, start-ups and innovation. He spent summer of 2017 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as an intern in Delta v program, leading development of the NLP platform of a FinTech startup (Sigma Ratings). Outside work, Pedram plays beach/indoor volleyball and ping pong (member of team A at GWU,) whenever he gets a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
